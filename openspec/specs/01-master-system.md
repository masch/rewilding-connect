# OpenSpec: Multi-Destination Impenetrable Reservation Platform

> **Tech Stack:** Bun (runtime) + Bun (package manager) — No npm/pnpm/yarn

## 1. System Overview
The platform is a reservation application designed for local residents and entrepreneurs within conservation projects, starting with the IMPE (Impenetrable) region [1]. The main goal is to manage requests for activities and gastronomic services using a fair and equitable rotation logic [1]. 

To achieve this, the system features an automated engine that replaces manual assignments, routing orders in a way that allows the entrepreneur to accept or reject the service [1]. Additionally, it provides a frictionless experience so tourists can easily access the app to request their daily activities or meals [1].

**Key Technical Context:** The application will be primarily used on **Web and Android** platforms. Because the user base (both local entrepreneurs and some tourists) lacks advanced smartphone skills, **ease of use and accessibility are the highest priorities**. Furthermore, the frontend must be highly optimized to run smoothly on **low-end mobile devices**.

## 2. Actors and Intentions (Roles)

> **MVP Scope:** Tourist (2.1), Entrepreneur (2.2), Engine Core (2.4 without Morning Reminder)

### 2.1. Tourist (Zero Friction) **[MVP]**
*   **Intention:** Request an activity or service quickly [1].
*   **Behavior & UX Constraints:**
    *   Eliminates the need for traditional user account creation to avoid friction [2].
    *   Accesses the platform by scanning a QR code (which already contains the Project ID, e.g., Impenetrable) [2].
    *   Identifies themselves using a mandatory "Alias" [2].
    *   The system uses a JWT auth_token (stored in secure storage) to recognize them for future requests [2]. Token auto-refreshes before expiration (7 days).

### 2.2. Entrepreneur **[MVP]**
*   **Intention:** Organize daily work and receive clients equitably through the rotation system [1, 2].
*   **Behavior & UX Constraints:**
    *   Each entrepreneur manages ONE Venture (business). Multiple entrepreneurs can manage the same Venture (e.g., family business).
    *   The entrepreneur can only offer items from the **Master Catalog** defined by the Admin for that Project, filtered by the Venture's Catalog_Type [2].
    *   The engine routes orders to the entrepreneur's Venture, and from their dashboard, they can accept or reject the request [2].
    *   **Calendar View:** The dashboard includes a simple calendar view to track assigned orders based on the service date and the specific time of day [2].
    *   **Individual Pause (Stock Control):** Can pause a specific catalog item if they run out of ingredients [2].
    *   **General Pause (Capacity Control):** Can disable the reception of all new requests if their business is full or closed [2].
    *   *UX Priority:* The dashboard must be native-feeling on Android, avoiding complex menus. Actions like "Accept/Reject" must be prominent and error-proof.

### 2.3. Impenetrable Admin **[POST-MVP]**
*   **Intention:** Audit the ecosystems, enable local hosts, and control regional catalogs [3].
*   **Behavior:**
    *   Enables the entrepreneur in the platform [3].
    *   *Evolution:* No longer performs manual request routing; this is now handled by the Backend Autonomous Engine [3].
    *   Manages the master catalog separated *by project* [3]. Can apply a **Global Pause** to an item across an entire region [3].
    *   Consumes a Monthly Reporting Dashboard (KPIs for acceptance rates, timeouts, and completed services) [3].

### 2.4. Autonomous Engine (Platform Backend) **[MVP]**
*   **Intention:** Guarantee the fair distribution of work per region without human intervention [4].
*   **Behavior:** 
    *   **Router:** Executes the Cascading Routing Algorithm, isolating the rotation lists for each Project [4].
    *   **Morning Reminder (Cron Job):** **[POST-MVP]** Runs a scheduled task early in the morning to find confirmed orders for the current day and sends the entrepreneur an automated reminder (via WhatsApp/Email) with their daily agenda [4].

## 3. Business Rules (Core Workflows)

### 3.1. Cascading Routing Flow (Project-Isolated) **[MVP]**

> **Note:** Cascade iterates through **Ventures** (sorted by cascade_order). Each Venture has a Catalog_Type that determines which Master Catalog items it can offer.

When a tourist submits a request:
1.  **Order Init**: Order is created with status `SEARCHING`. The engine starts iterating through **Ventures** sorted by `cascade_order` (ascending).
2.  **Filter Phase**: For each venture in rotation order:
    - Skip if `venture.is_active = false` → record `skip_reason = VENTURE_INACTIVE`
    - Skip if `venture.is_paused = true` → record `skip_reason = GENERAL_PAUSE`
    - Skip if `catalog_item_id` is in `venture.paused_items` → record `skip_reason = INDIVIDUAL_PAUSE`
    - Skip if `guest_count > venture.max_capacity` → record `skip_reason = CAPACITY_EXCEEDED`
    - Skip if `service_date` day is not in `venture.opening_hours` → record `skip_reason = CLOSED_THAT_DAY`
    - Skip if requested time is outside `venture.opening_hours` range → record `skip_reason = OUTSIDE_OPENING_HOURS`
3.  **Offer Phase**: First venture that passes filters gets the offer:
    - Create Cascade_Assignment with `offer_status = WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE`
    - Set `response_deadline = now + project.cascade_timeout_minutes`
    - Send notification to all entrepreneurs linked to this venture
4.  **Response Handling**:
    - **Accept**: Update Order status to `CONFIRMED`, set `confirmed_venture_id`, mark assignment as `ACCEPTED`
    - **Reject**: Mark assignment as `REJECTED`, continue to next venture in rotation
    - **Timeout**: Mark assignment as `TIMEOUT`, continue to next venture
5.  **Termination Conditions**:
    - **Success**: Linked entrepreneur accepts → Order becomes `CONFIRMED`
    - **Max Attempts**: After `project.max_cascade_attempts` rejections/timeouts → Order becomes `EXPIRED` with cancel_reason `NO_VENTURE_AVAILABLE`
    - **All Paused**: If ALL ventures are skipped (General/Individual Pause) → Order becomes `EXPIRED` with cancel_reason `NO_VENTURE_AVAILABLE`
    - **Tourist Cancel**: Order becomes `CANCELLED` with cancel_reason `BY_TOURIST`

**Initial Cascade Order**: Default is creation order (1, 2, 3...). Admin can manually reorder ventures in the Admin Panel to change rotation priority.

### 3.2. Internationalization (i18n) **[POST-MVP]**

> **MVP:** Only Spanish (`es`) is required. i18n structure in place but not active.
*   Dynamic Catalog data (dish and activity names) are stored in the database using PostgreSQL's native `JSONB` type [6].
*   This allows the system to quickly extract translations (e.g., `{"es": "Guiso", "en": "Stew"}) based on the tourist's browser `Accept-Language` header [6].

**Fallback Strategy:**
1. Use the language from `Accept-Language` header (e.g., "es", "en", "fr")
2. If the requested language is not available, fall back to the project's `default_language`
3. If the default language is also not available, use the first available language in the translation object
4. If no translation exists at all, return the key (e.g., "ORDER_CONFIRMED") as the message

**Translation Helper:**
```typescript
function getTranslation(translations: Record<string, string>, acceptLanguage: string, defaultLang: string): string {
    const lang = acceptLanguage.split(',')[0].slice(0, 2); // 'es' from 'es,en;q=0.9'
    
    if (translations[lang]) return translations[lang];
    if (translations[defaultLang]) return translations[defaultLang];
    return Object.values(translations)[0] || lang; // First available or lang code
}
```

**Supported Languages per Project:** Each project defines its supported languages in `Project.supported_languages` (JSON array, e.g., `["es", "en", "pt"]`). The first language in the array is the default.

### 3.3. Validation Rules **[MVP]**

#### 3.3.1 Order Creation Validations

When a tourist creates an order, the following validations must pass:

| Field | Validation Rule | Error Message |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| `service_date` | Required | "Date is required" |
| `service_date` | Must be >= TODAY | "Cannot order for past dates" |
| `service_date` | Must be <= TODAY + 30 days | "Cannot order more than 30 days in advance" |
| `guest_count` | Required | "Number of guests is required" |
| `guest_count` | Must be >= 1 | "At least 1 guest is required" |
| `guest_count` | Must be <= 100 | "Maximum 100 guests per order" |
| `items` | Required, min 1 | "At least 1 item is required" |
| `items` | Max 10 unique items | "Maximum 10 items per order" |
| `time_of_day_id` | Required | "Time of day is required" |

#### 3.3.2 Venture Availability Validations (Filter Phase)

> **Note:** Business fields are now in Venture entity. Cascade iterates through Ventures.

Before offering an order to a venture, the engine validates:

| Check | Condition | Skip Reason |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Venture Active | `venture.is_active = true` | `VENTURE_INACTIVE` |
| General Pause | `venture.is_paused = false` | `GENERAL_PAUSE` |
| Capacity | `order.guest_count <= venture.max_capacity` | `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED` |
| Individual Pause | `catalog_item_id NOT IN venture.paused_items` | `INDIVIDUAL_PAUSE` |
| **Opening Hours** | Order time within `venture.opening_hours` for the day | `CLOSED_THAT_DAY` |

**Opening Hours Logic:**
```typescript
function isVentureOpen(venture: Venture, serviceDate: Date, timeOfDayId: number): boolean {
    const dayOfWeek = getDayOfWeek(serviceDate); // 'mon', 'tue', ...
    const hours = venture.opening_hours[dayOfWeek];
    
    if (!hours) return false; // Venture is closed that day
    
    const [openTime, closeTime] = hours.split('-');
    const orderTime = getStartTimeForTimeOfDay(timeOfDayId); // e.g., '12:00' for LUNCH
    
    return orderTime >= openTime && orderTime < closeTime;
}
```

#### 3.3.3 Order Status Transitions

Valid transitions between order states:

```
SEARCHING ──accept──> CONFIRMED ──complete──> COMPLETED
   │
   ├──cancel──> CANCELLED (by tourist)
   │
   └──expire──> EXPIRED (no venture available / all skipped)
```

**State Transition Rules:**
- `SEARCHING` → `CONFIRMED`: When linked entrepreneur accepts for their venture
- `SEARCHING` → `CANCELLED`: When tourist cancels (only if status = SEARCHING)
- `SEARCHING` → `EXPIRED`: When max cascade attempts reached or all ventures skipped
- `CONFIRMED` → `COMPLETED`: When service date passes + no NO_SHOW reported
- `CONFIRMED` → `NO_SHOW`: When linked entrepreneur marks tourist as no-show

#### 3.3.4 Cascade Skip Reasons

Complete list of skip reasons in `Cascade_Assignment.skip_reason`:

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `null` | Venture was offered (not skipped) |
| `GENERAL_PAUSE` | Venture has is_paused = true |
| `INDIVIDUAL_PAUSE` | catalog_item_id is in venture.paused_items |
| `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED` | guest_count > venture.max_capacity |
| `CLOSED_THAT_DAY` | Venture is closed on the requested day (not in opening_hours) |
| `OUTSIDE_OPENING_HOURS` | Requested time is outside venture's operating hours |
| `VENTURE_INACTIVE` | Venture.is_active = false |
| `NOT_OFFERED` | Venture was not in the rotation list |

#### 3.3.5 Order Duplication Prevention

A tourist cannot have multiple active orders for the same:
- `service_date` + `time_of_day_id`

If such order exists with status `SEARCHING` or `CONFIRMED`, the system returns error: "You already have an order for this time slot"

#### 3.3.6 Capacity Calculation

When checking if a venture can accept an order:

```typescript
function getCurrentGuestCount(ventureId: number, serviceDate: Date, timeOfDayId: number): number {
    // Sum of guest_count for CONFIRMED orders at same date/time
    return SUM(o.guest_count) FROM Order o
    WHERE o.confirmed_venture_id = ventureId
      AND o.service_date = serviceDate
      AND o.time_of_day_id = time_of_day_id
      AND o.status IN ('SEARCHING', 'CONFIRMED');
}

function canAcceptOrder(venture: Venture, order: Order): boolean {
    const currentGuests = getCurrentGuestCount(venture.id, order.service_date, order.time_of_day_id);
    return (currentGuests + order.guest_count) <= venture.max_capacity;
}
```

## 4. Technical Architecture & Tech Stack

To meet the requirement of running smoothly on low-end devices while serving Web and Android users efficiently:

*   **Frontend Framework:** **React Native using Expo**. This allows writing a single codebase that compiles into a lightweight Android application (APK/AAB) and a responsive Web application.
*   **Performance Constraint:** Avoid heavy UI animations and large client-side bundle sizes to ensure performance on low-end hardware.
*   **Backend Framework:** **Node.js with TypeScript**. This enables sharing interfaces and type definitions between the frontend and backend, ensuring end-to-end type safety.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (ERD defined below).

### 4.1 Security Requirements

*   **Authentication:**
    *   **Entrepreneur/Admin:** JWT-based authentication with email/password. Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies (web) or secure storage (mobile).
    *   **Tourist:** JWT token with 7-day expiration. Auto-renewal before expiration. No traditional login required — token generated on first visit.
*   **Password Security:** Use bcrypt or argon2 for password hashing with cost factor 10+.
*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   Global: 100 requests/minute per IP
    *   Order creation: 10 orders/minute per device token
    *   Auth endpoints: 5 attempts/minute per IP
*   **Account Lockout:** After 5 failed login attempts, lock account for 15 minutes.
*   **Input Validation:** All inputs sanitized. SQL injection prevented via parameterized queries (Knex/Prisma). XSS prevented via output encoding.
*   **API Security:** All endpoints require authentication except: `POST /auth/login`, `POST /orders` (tourist), `GET /catalog`.

### 4.2 API Design

All endpoints follow RESTful conventions. Base URL: `https://api.elimpenetrable.org/v1`

```

### 4.3 Real-Time Notifications

> **MVP:** Push Notifications only (4.3.1). WhatsApp (4.3.3) and Polling fallback (4.3.2) are **[POST-MVP]**.

#### 4.3.1 Push Notifications (Primary) **[MVP]**

**Providers:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Expo Push Notifications

**Flow:**
1. App registers with FCM → obtains device push token
2. Push token stored in `Notification_Preference`
3. When event occurs → backend sends to FCM → FCM delivers to device

**Device Registration Endpoint:**
```
POST /notifications/register
Request: { "push_token": "ExponentPushToken[xxx]" }
Response: { "success": true }
```

**Events that trigger Push Notifications:**

| Event | Recipient | Channel | Content |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `ORDER_RECEIVED` | Entrepreneur | Push | "Nuevo pedido: X personas, [items]" |
| `ORDER_CANCELLED` | Entrepreneur | Push | "El cliente canceló el pedido #X" |
| `ORDER_CONFIRMED` | Tourist | Push + WhatsApp | "Tu reserva está confirmada para [fecha] en [venture]" |
| `ORDER_EXPIRED` | Tourist | Push | "Lo sentimos, no hay disponibilidad para tu solicitud" |
| `MORNING_REMINDER` | Entrepreneur | Push + WhatsApp | "Hoy tienes X pedidos confirmados" |

#### 4.3.2 Polling (Fallback) **[POST-MVP]**

For devices without push token or when push fails, the app polls periodically.

**Polling Endpoint:**
```
GET /orders/pending?last_check=timestamp
Response: { "has_new": true/false, "orders": [...] }
```

**Polling Strategy:**

| Scenario | Interval | Trigger |
|----------|----------|---------|
| App in foreground | 30 seconds | Automatic |
| App in background | 5 minutes | Background fetch |
| On app resume | Immediate | Event listener |

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Frontend polling
const startPolling = () => {
  setInterval(async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/orders/pending');
    const { orders } = await response.json();
    if (orders.length > 0) showLocalNotification(orders);
  }, 30000);
};
```

#### 4.3.3 WhatsApp Notifications **[POST-MVP]**

For high-priority notifications to tourists (confirmation, expiration).

**Provider:** WhatsApp Business API (Meta)

**Flow:**
1. Tourist provides WhatsApp number in profile
2. Backend sends via WhatsApp Business API
3. Message ID stored in `Notification.external_id`

**Endpoint:**
```
POST /notifications/whatsapp
Request: { "to": "+54911...", "template": "order_confirmed", "params": {...} }
Response: { "message_id": "wamid.xxx" }
```

#### 4.3.4 Notification Preference

Users can configure their notification preferences:

```
PUT /notifications/preferences
Request: {
  "push_enabled": true,
  "whatsapp_enabled": true,
  "email_enabled": false
}
Response: { "success": true }
```

### 4.4 Error Responses

All errors follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid input",
    "details": [

## 4.6 Testing Strategy **[MVP]**

> **MVP:** Only Unit Tests for Cascade Engine required. Integration/E2E are **[POST-MVP]**.

### 4.6.1 Testing Pyramid

```
        /\
       /  \
      / E2E \         ← Few, slow, expensive
     /--------\
    /Integration\    ← Medium, test component interaction
   /--------------\
  /    Unit        \ ← Many, fast, cheap
 /__________________\
```

### 4.6.2 Unit Tests

**Framework:** Bun Test (Vitest-compatible)

**Coverage Target:** 80% minimum

**What to Test:**

| Module | Test Cases |
|--------|------------|
| **CascadeEngine** | Skip logic for all 8 skip reasons, capacity calculation, max attempts |
| **i18n** | Fallback strategy, missing language handling |
| **Auth** | Token refresh, lockout logic, JWT validation |
| **Validation** | All validation rules from Section 3.3 |
| **Order** | Status transitions, duplication prevention |

**Example:**
```typescript
describe('CascadeEngine', () => {
  describe('filterVenture', () => {
    it('skips when venture.is_active = false', () => {
      const venture = { is_active: false, ... };
      const result = filterVenture(venture, order);
      expect(result.skip).toBe(true);
      expect(result.reason).toBe('VENTURE_INACTIVE');
    });

    it('skips when general_pause = true', () => {
      const venture = { general_pause: true, ... };
      const result = filterVenture(venture, order);
      expect(result.skip).toBe(true);
      expect(result.reason).toBe('GENERAL_PAUSE');
    });

    it('skips when guest_count > max_capacity', () => {
      const venture = { max_capacity: 10, ... };
      const order = { guest_count: 15 };
      const result = filterVenture(venture, order);
      expect(result.skip).toBe(true);
      expect(result.reason).toBe('CAPACITY_EXCEEDED');
    });

    it('skips when outside opening_hours', () => {
      const venture = { opening_hours: { mon: '08:00-20:00' } };
      const order = { service_date: '2024-01-15', time_of_day_id: LUNCH }; // 12:00
      const result = filterVenture(venture, order);
      expect(result.skip).toBe(false);
    });
  });

  describe('cascadeLoop', () => {
    it('marks EXPIRED after max_attempts', async () => {
      const ventures = [...Array(10).keys()].map(i => ({ id: i, ... }));
      const result = await cascadeLoop(order, ventures, { max_attempts: 10 });
      expect(result.status).toBe('EXPIRED');
    });

    it('returns CONFIRMED on first accept', async () => {
      const ventures = [{ id: 1, ... }];
      const result = await cascadeLoop(order, ventures, {});
      expect(result.status).toBe('CONFIRMED');
    });
  });
});
```

### 4.6.3 Integration Tests

**Framework:** Supertest (API) + Test Database

**What to Test:**

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Order Flow** | Tourist creates order → enters SEARCHING → venture accepts → becomes CONFIRMED |
| **Cascade Flow** | Order creates → skips paused ventures → reaches active venture → accepts |
| **Auth Flow** | Tourist creates identity → gets JWT → refreshes token → token invalidates old |
| **Notification Flow** | Order confirmed → notification created → sent via provider |

**Example:**
```typescript
describe('Order API', () => {
  it('creates order and triggers cascade', async () => {
    // Create order
    const orderRes = await request(app)
      .post('/orders')
      .send({ ... });
    
    expect(orderRes.status).toBe(201);
    expect(orderRes.body.status).toBe('SEARCHING');

    // Check cascade assignment created
    const assignment = await db.query(
      'SELECT * FROM cascade_assignment WHERE order_id = ?',
      [orderRes.body.order_id]
    );
    expect(assignment).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(assignment[0].offer_status).toBe('WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE');
  });

  it('accepts order and confirms', async () => {
    // Given: order in SEARCHING
    const order = await createOrder({ status: 'SEARCHING' });

    // When: entrepreneur accepts
    const acceptRes = await request(app)
      .post(`/orders/${order.id}/accept`)
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${entrepreneurToken}`);

    // Then: order is CONFIRMED
    expect(acceptRes.body.status).toBe('CONFIRMED');
    
    const updatedOrder = await getOrder(order.id);
    expect(updatedOrder.status).toBe('CONFIRMED');
  });
});
```

### 4.6.4 E2E Tests

**Framework:** Playwright (recommended)

**Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Steps |
|----------|-------|
| **Tourist: Create Order** | 1. Open app → 2. Enter alias → 3. Browse catalog → 4. Select item → 5. Choose date/time → 6. Submit → 7. See "SEARCHING" status |
| **Entrepreneur: Accept Order** | 1. Login → 2. See pending order → 3. Tap Accept → 4. See confirmation |
| **Full Cascade** | 1. Tourist creates order → 2. Venture A rejects → 3. Venture B accepts → 4. Tourist sees CONFIRMED |

**Example:**
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('tourist creates order', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  
  // Welcome screen
  await page.fill('[name=alias]', 'Test Family');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Start")');
  
  // Catalog
  await expect(page.locator('text=Service Catalog')).toBeVisible();
  await page.click('text=Guiso');
  
  // Order modal
  await page.selectOption('[name=time_of_day]', 'LUNCH');
  await page.fill('[name=guest_count]', '4');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Confirm")');
  
  // Orders screen
  await expect(page.locator('text=SEARCHING')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### 4.6.5 Load Testing

**Tool:** k6 or Artillery

**Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Target |
|----------|--------|
| **Order Creation** | 100 orders/minute |
| **Cascade Engine** | 50 entrepreneurs, 10 attempts each |
| **Concurrent Accepts** | 10 entrepreneurs accepting simultaneously |
| **Calendar View** | 1000 confirmed orders |

**Example (k6):**
```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';

export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: '1m',
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],
  },
};

export default function () {
  const order = {
    project_id: 1,
    service_date: '2024-01-15',
    time_of_day_id: 1,
    guest_count: 4,
    items: [{ catalog_item_id: 1, quantity: 2 }],
  };

  http.post('http://localhost:3000/v1/orders', 
    JSON.stringify(order),
    { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
  );
}
```

### 4.6.6 Test Database Strategy

**Development:**
- Use `testcontainers` for isolated PostgreSQL
- Each test gets clean database state

**CI/CD:**
- Use ephemeral database per build
- Run migrations before tests
- Seed with minimal data

```typescript
// Test setup
beforeAll(async () => {
  const container = await new PostgreSqlContainer().start();
  await runMigrations(container.getConnectionUrl());
});

afterAll(async () => {
  await container.stop();
});

beforeEach(async () => {
  await truncateAllTables();
  await seedTestData();
});
```

### 4.6.7 Test Coverage Requirements

| Type | Minimum Coverage | Tools |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Unit | 80% | Bun Test + coverage report |
| Integration | All API endpoints | Supertest |
| E2E | Critical paths only | Playwright |
| Load | Key endpoints | k6 |

### 4.6.8 Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (fast, runs on every commit)
bun test

# With coverage
bun test --coverage
```

## 6. UI/UX Mockup Specifications (Google Stitch / Design Guidelines) **[MVP]**

> **MVP:** Tourist Flow (6.2) + Entrepreneur Flow (6.3). Admin Flow (6.4) is **[POST-MVP]**.
When generating UI components or screens, adhere strictly to the following constraints tailored for low-end Android devices and non-technical users.
6.1 Global Design Guidelines

    Visual & Accessible: Use high-contrast colors, extremely large buttons (wide touch areas), and highly legible typography. Use the colors of the Impenetrable Chaco: 
    Performance: The UI must be lightweight. Strictly avoid complex animations, heavy shadows, or overlapping elements that consume RAM on low-end phones.
    Navigation: Avoid complex hamburger menus or multi-step wizard flows. Keep actions flat and immediate.
