# OpenSpec: Multi-Destination Impenetrable Reservation Platform

## 1. System Overview
The platform is a reservation application designed for local residents and entrepreneurs within conservation projects, starting with the IMPE (Impenetrable) region [1]. The main goal is to manage requests for activities and gastronomic services using a fair and equitable rotation logic [1]. 

To achieve this, the system features an automated engine that replaces manual assignments, routing orders in a way that allows the entrepreneur to accept or reject the service [1]. Additionally, it provides a frictionless experience so tourists can easily access the app to request their daily activities or meals [1].

**Key Technical Context:** The application will be primarily used on **Web and Android** platforms. Because the user base (both local entrepreneurs and some tourists) lacks advanced smartphone skills, **ease of use and accessibility are the highest priorities**. Furthermore, the frontend must be highly optimized to run smoothly on **low-end mobile devices**.

## 2. Actors and Intentions (Roles)

### 2.1. Tourist (Zero Friction)
*   **Intention:** Request an activity or service quickly [1].
*   **Behavior & UX Constraints:**
    *   Eliminates the need for traditional user account creation to avoid friction [2].
    *   Accesses the platform by scanning a QR code (which already contains the Project ID, e.g., Impenetrable) [2].
    *   Identifies themselves using a mandatory "Alias" [2].
    *   The system uses a JWT auth_token (stored in secure storage) to recognize them for future requests [2]. Token auto-refreshes before expiration (7 days).

### 2.2. Entrepreneur & Venture (Business)
*   **Intention:** Organize daily work and receive clients equitably through the rotation system [1, 2].
*   **Behavior & UX Constraints:**
    *   Registers their venture [2]. A single entrepreneur (owner) can manage multiple physical ventures (businesses) associated with a Project [2].
    *   Registers activities or gastronomic services [2].
    *   The engine routes orders to their business, and from their dashboard, they can accept or reject the request [2].
    *   **Calendar View:** The dashboard includes a simple calendar view to track assigned orders based on the service date and the specific time of day [2].
    *   **Individual Pause (Stock Control):** Can pause a specific catalog item if they run out of ingredients [2].
    *   **General Pause (Capacity Control):** Can disable the reception of all new requests if their business is full or closed [2].
    *   *UX Priority:* The dashboard must be native-feeling on Android, avoiding complex menus. Actions like "Accept/Reject" must be prominent and error-proof.

### 2.3. Impenetrable Admin
*   **Intention:** Audit the ecosystems, enable local hosts, and control regional catalogs [3].
*   **Behavior:**
    *   Enables the entrepreneur in the platform [3].
    *   *Evolution:* No longer performs manual request routing; this is now handled by the Backend Autonomous Engine [3].
    *   Manages the master catalog separated *by project* [3]. Can apply a **Global Pause** to an item across an entire region [3].
    *   Consumes a Monthly Reporting Dashboard (KPIs for acceptance rates, timeouts, and completed services) [3].

### 2.4. Autonomous Engine (Platform Backend)
*   **Intention:** Guarantee the fair distribution of work per region without human intervention [4].
*   **Behavior:** 
    *   **Router:** Executes the Cascading Routing Algorithm, isolating the rotation lists for each Project [4].
    *   **Morning Reminder (Cron Job):** Runs a scheduled task early in the morning to find confirmed orders for the current day and sends the entrepreneur an automated reminder (via WhatsApp/Email) with their daily agenda [4].

## 3. Business Rules (Core Workflows)

### 3.1. Cascading Routing Flow (Project-Isolated)
When a tourist submits a request:
1.  **Order Init**: Order is created with status `SEARCHING`. The engine starts iterating through ventures sorted by `cascade_order` (ascending).
2.  **Filter Phase**: For each venture in rotation order:
    - Skip if `venture.is_active = false` → record `skip_reason = VENTURE_INACTIVE`
    - Skip if `general_pause = true` → record `skip_reason = GENERAL_PAUSE`
    - Skip if Venture_Item has `individual_pause = true` for requested Catalog_Item → record `skip_reason = INDIVIDUAL_PAUSE`
    - Skip if `guest_count > venture.max_capacity` → record `skip_reason = CAPACITY_EXCEEDED`
    - Skip if `service_date` day is not in `venture.opening_hours` → record `skip_reason = CLOSED_THAT_DAY`
    - Skip if requested time is outside `venture.opening_hours` range → record `skip_reason = OUTSIDE_OPENING_HOURS`
3.  **Offer Phase**: First venture that passes filters gets the offer:
    - Create Cascade_Assignment with `offer_status = WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE`
    - Set `response_deadline = now + project.cascade_timeout_minutes`
    - Send notification to entrepreneur
4.  **Response Handling**:
    - **Accept**: Update Order status to `CONFIRMED`, set `confirmed_venture_id`, mark assignment as `ACCEPTED`
    - **Reject**: Mark assignment as `REJECTED`, continue to next venture in rotation
    - **Timeout**: Mark assignment as `TIMEOUT`, continue to next venture
5.  **Termination Conditions**:
    - **Success**: Venture accepts → Order becomes `CONFIRMED`
    - **Max Attempts**: After `project.max_cascade_attempts` rejections/timeouts → Order becomes `EXPIRED` with cancel_reason `NO_VENTURE_AVAILABLE`
    - **All Paused**: If ALL ventures are skipped (General/Individual Pause) → Order becomes `EXPIRED` with cancel_reason `NO_VENTURE_AVAILABLE`
    - **Tourist Cancel**: Order becomes `CANCELLED` with cancel_reason `BY_TOURIST`

**Initial Cascade Order**: Default is creation order (1, 2, 3...). Admin can manually reorder ventures in the Admin Panel to change rotation priority.

### 3.2. Internationalization (i18n)
*   Dynamic Catalog data (dish and activity names) are stored in the database using PostgreSQL's native `JSONB` type [6].
*   This allows the system to quickly extract translations (e.g., `{"es": "Guiso", "en": "Stew"}) based on the tourist's browser `Accept-Language` header [6].

### 3.3. Validation Rules

#### 3.3.1 Order Creation Validations

When a tourist creates an order, the following validations must pass:

| Field | Validation Rule | Error Message |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| `service_date` | Required | "Date is required" |
| `service_date` | Must be >= TODAY | "Cannot order for past dates" |
| `service_date` | Must be <= TODAY + 30 days | "Cannot order more than 30 days in advance" |
| `guest_count` | Required | "Number of guests is required" |
| `guest_count` | Must be >= 1 | "At least 1 guest is required" |
| `guest_count` | Must be <= 100 | "Maximum 100 guests per order" |
| `items` | Required, min 1 | "At least 1 item is required" |
| `items` | Max 10 unique items | "Maximum 10 items per order" |
| `time_of_day_id` | Required | "Time of day is required" |

#### 3.3.2 Venture Availability Validations (Filter Phase)

Before offering an order to a venture, the engine validates:

| Check | Condition | Skip Reason |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Venture Active | `venture.is_active = true` | `VENTURE_INACTIVE` |
| General Pause | `venture.general_pause = false` | `GENERAL_PAUSE` |
| Capacity | `order.guest_count <= venture.max_capacity` | `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED` |
| Individual Pause | `venture_item.individual_pause = false` for all items | `INDIVIDUAL_PAUSE` |
| **Opening Hours** | Order time within `venture.opening_hours` for the day | `CLOSED_THAT_DAY` |

**Opening Hours Logic:**
```typescript
function isVentureOpen(venture: Venture, serviceDate: Date, timeOfDayId: number): boolean {
    const dayOfWeek = getDayOfWeek(serviceDate); // 'mon', 'tue', ...
    const hours = venture.opening_hours[dayOfWeek];
    
    if (!hours) return false; // Venture is closed that day
    
    const [openTime, closeTime] = hours.split('-');
    const orderTime = getStartTimeForTimeOfDay(timeOfDayId); // e.g., '12:00' for LUNCH
    
    return orderTime >= openTime && orderTime < closeTime;
}
```

#### 3.3.3 Order Status Transitions

Valid transitions between order states:

```
SEARCHING ──accept──> CONFIRMED ──complete──> COMPLETED
   │                          │
   │                          └──no-show──> NO_SHOW
   │
   ├──cancel──> CANCELLED (by tourist)
   │
   └──expire──> EXPIRED (no venture available / all skipped)
```

**State Transition Rules:**
- `SEARCHING` → `CONFIRMED`: When entrepreneur accepts
- `SEARCHING` → `CANCELLED`: When tourist cancels (only if status = SEARCHING)
- `SEARCHING` → `EXPIRED`: When max cascade attempts reached or all ventures skipped
- `CONFIRMED` → `COMPLETED`: When service date passes + no NO_SHOW reported
- `CONFIRMED` → `NO_SHOW`: When entrepreneur marks tourist as no-show

#### 3.3.4 Cascade Skip Reasons

Complete list of skip reasons in `Cascade_Assignment.skip_reason`:

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `null` | Venture was offered (not skipped) |
| `GENERAL_PAUSE` | Venture has general_pause = true |
| `INDIVIDUAL_PAUSE` | Venture_Item has individual_pause = true for requested item |
| `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED` | guest_count > venture.max_capacity |
| `CLOSED_THAT_DAY` | Venture is closed on the requested day (not in opening_hours) |
| `OUTSIDE_OPENING_HOURS` | Requested time is outside venture's operating hours |
| `VENTURE_INACTIVE` | Venture.is_active = false |
| `NOT_OFFERED` | Venture was not in the rotation list |

#### 3.3.5 Order Duplication Prevention

A tourist cannot have multiple active orders for the same:
- `service_date` + `time_of_day_id`

If such order exists with status `SEARCHING` or `CONFIRMED`, the system returns error: "You already have an order for this time slot"

#### 3.3.6 Capacity Calculation

When checking if a venture can accept an order:

```typescript
function getCurrentGuestCount(ventureId: number, serviceDate: Date, timeOfDayId: number): number {
    // Sum of guest_count for CONFIRMED orders at same date/time
    return SUM(o.guest_count) FROM Order o
    WHERE o.confirmed_venture_id = ventureId
      AND o.service_date = serviceDate
      AND o.time_of_day_id = timeOfDayId
      AND o.status IN ('SEARCHING', 'CONFIRMED');
}

function canAcceptOrder(venture: Venture, order: Order): boolean {
    const currentGuests = getCurrentGuestCount(venture.id, order.service_date, order.time_of_day_id);
    return (currentGuests + order.guest_count) <= venture.max_capacity;
}
```

## 4. Technical Architecture & Tech Stack

To meet the requirement of running smoothly on low-end devices while serving Web and Android users efficiently:

*   **Frontend Framework:** **React Native using Expo**. This allows writing a single codebase that compiles into a lightweight Android application (APK/AAB) and a responsive Web application.
*   **Performance Constraint:** Avoid heavy UI animations and large client-side bundle sizes to ensure performance on low-end hardware.
*   **Backend Framework:** **Node.js with TypeScript**. This enables sharing interfaces and type definitions between the frontend and backend, ensuring end-to-end type safety.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (ERD defined below).

### 4.1 Security Requirements

*   **Authentication:**
    *   **Entrepreneur/Admin:** JWT-based authentication with email/password. Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies (web) or secure storage (mobile).
    *   **Tourist:** JWT token with 7-day expiration. Auto-renewal before expiration. No traditional login required — token generated on first visit.
*   **Password Security:** Use bcrypt or argon2 for password hashing with cost factor 10+.
*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   Global: 100 requests/minute per IP
    *   Order creation: 10 orders/minute per device token
    *   Auth endpoints: 5 attempts/minute per IP
*   **Account Lockout:** After 5 failed login attempts, lock account for 15 minutes.
*   **Input Validation:** All inputs sanitized. SQL injection prevented via parameterized queries (Knex/Prisma). XSS prevented via output encoding.
*   **API Security:** All endpoints require authentication except: `POST /auth/login`, `POST /orders` (tourist), `GET /catalog`.

## 5. Data Structure (Multi-Project ERD)

Below is the relational data model prepared for AI generation using PostgreSQL. Operational states are kept as Enums to protect the cascading engine's strict logic, while expansible categories use parametric tables [6].
