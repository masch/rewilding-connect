# OpenSpec: Multi-Destination Impenetrable Reservation Platform

> **Tech Stack:** Bun (runtime) + Bun (package manager) — No npm/pnpm/yarn

## 1. System Overview
The platform is a reservation application designed for local residents and entrepreneurs within conservation projects, starting with the IMPE (Impenetrable) region [1]. The main goal is to manage requests for activities and gastronomic services using a fair and equitable rotation logic [1]. 

To achieve this, the system features an automated engine that replaces manual assignments, routing orders in a way that allows the entrepreneur to accept or reject the service [1]. Additionally, it provides a frictionless experience so tourists can easily access the app to request their daily activities or meals [1].

**Key Technical Context:** The application will be primarily used on **Web and Android** platforms. Because the user base (both local entrepreneurs and some tourists) lacks advanced smartphone skills, **ease of use and accessibility are the highest priorities**. Furthermore, the frontend must be highly optimized to run smoothly on **low-end mobile devices**.

## 2. Actors and Intentions (Roles)

> **MVP Scope:** Tourist (2.1), Entrepreneur (2.2), Engine Core (2.4 without Morning Reminder)

### 2.1. Tourist (Zero Friction) **[MVP]**
*   **Intention:** Request an activity or service quickly [1].
*   **Behavior & UX Constraints:**
    *   Eliminates the need for traditional user account creation to avoid friction [2].
    *   Accesses the platform by scanning a QR code (which already contains the Project ID, e.g., Impenetrable) [2].
    *   Identifies themselves using a mandatory "Alias" [2].
    *   **Authentication (Tourist - No Login):** No login required. Access tokens (1 hour) + refresh tokens (30 days) bound to browser fingerprint. This replaces the previous 7-day JWT approach.

### 2.2. Entrepreneur **[MVP]**
*   **Intention:** Organize daily work and receive clients equitably through the rotation system [1, 2].
*   **Behavior & UX Constraints:**
    *   Each entrepreneur can manage ONE OR MORE Ventures through the Venture_Manager relationship. Multiple entrepreneurs can manage the same Venture (e.g., family business).
    *   The entrepreneur can only offer items from the **Master Catalog** defined by the Admin for that Project, filtered by the Venture's Catalog_Type [2].
    *   The engine routes orders to the entrepreneur's Venture, and from their dashboard, they can accept or reject the request [2].
    *   **Calendar View:** The dashboard includes a simple calendar view to track assigned orders based on the service date and the specific time of day [2].
    *   **Individual Pause (Stock Control):** Can pause a specific catalog item if they run out of ingredients [2].
    *   **General Pause (Capacity Control):** Can disable the reception of all new requests if their business is full or closed [2].
    *   *UX Priority:* The dashboard must be native-feeling on Android, avoiding complex menus. Actions like "Accept/Reject" must be prominent and error-proof.

### 2.3. Impenetrable Admin **[POST-MVP]**
*   **Intention:** Audit the ecosystems, enable local hosts, and control regional catalogs [3].
*   **Behavior:**
    *   Enables the entrepreneur in the platform [3].
    *   *Evolution:* No longer performs manual request routing; this is now handled by the Backend Autonomous Engine [3].
    *   Manages the master catalog separated *by project* [3]. Can apply a **Global Pause** to an item across an entire region [3].
    *   Consumes a Monthly Reporting Dashboard (KPIs for acceptance rates, timeouts, and completed services) [3].

> **MVP Alternative:** In the absence of the Admin Panel, all data management (creating Projects, Catalog Types, Catalog Items, Ventures, Entrepreneurs, and Venture Schedules) is performed via **CLI seed scripts** (`bun run db:seed`). The seed script reads from a structured JSON/TS configuration file that can be versioned in the repository. This is sufficient for the initial deployment with a single project (Impenetrable) and a known set of entrepreneurs.

### 2.4. Autonomous Engine (Platform Backend) **[MVP]**
*   **Intention:** Guarantee the fair distribution of work per region without human intervention [4].
*   **Behavior:** 
    *   **Router:** Executes the Cascading Routing Algorithm, isolating the rotation lists for each Project [4].
    *   **Morning Reminder (Cron Job):** **[POST-MVP]** Runs a scheduled task early in the morning to find confirmed orders for the current day and sends the entrepreneur an automated reminder (via WhatsApp/Email) with their daily agenda [4].

## 3. Business Rules (Core Workflows)

### 3.1. Cascading Routing Flow (Project-Isolated) **[MVP]**

> **Note:** Cascade iterates through **Ventures** (sorted by cascade_order). The engine infers the required Catalog_Type from `order.catalog_item_id` → `Catalog_Item.catalog_type_id`, then filters ventures that match that type.

When a tourist submits a request:
1.  **Order Init**: Order is created with status `SEARCHING`. The engine starts iterating through **Ventures** (filtered by Catalog_Type) sorted by `cascade_order` (ascending).
2.  **Filter Phase**: For each venture in rotation order:
    - Skip if `venture.is_active = false` → record `skip_reason = VENTURE_INACTIVE`
    - Skip if `venture.is_paused = true` → record `skip_reason = GENERAL_PAUSE`
    - Skip if `catalog_item_id` is in `Venture_Paused_Item` for this venture → record `skip_reason = INDIVIDUAL_PAUSE`
    - Skip if `(current_occupation + guest_count) > venture.max_capacity` → record `skip_reason = CAPACITY_EXCEEDED`
    - Skip if no matching `Venture_Schedule` for service_date day → record `skip_reason = CLOSED_THAT_DAY`
    - Skip if requested time is outside `Venture_Schedule` range → record `skip_reason = OUTSIDE_OPENING_HOURS`
3.  **Offer Phase**: First venture that passes filters gets the offer:
    - Create Cascade_Assignment with `offer_status = WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE`
    - Set `response_deadline = now + project.cascade_timeout_minutes`
    - Send notification to all entrepreneurs linked to this venture
4.  **Response Handling**:
    - **Accept**: Update Order status to `CONFIRMED`, set `confirmed_venture_id`, mark assignment as `ACCEPTED`
    - **Reject**: Mark assignment as `REJECTED`, continue to next venture in rotation
    - **Timeout**: Mark assignment as `TIMEOUT`, continue to next venture
5.  **Termination Conditions**:
    - **Success**: Linked entrepreneur accepts → Order becomes `CONFIRMED`
    - **Max Attempts**: After `project.max_cascade_steps` rejections/timeouts → Order becomes `EXPIRED` with cancel_reason `NO_VENTURE_AVAILABLE`
    - **All Paused**: If ALL ventures are skipped (General/Individual Pause) → Order becomes `EXPIRED` with cancel_reason `NO_VENTURE_AVAILABLE`
    - **Tourist Cancel**: Order becomes `CANCELLED` with cancel_reason `BY_TOURIST`
    - **Entrepreneur Cancel**: Confirmed order cancelled by entrepreneur → Order becomes `SEARCHING` (cascade restarts), cancel_reason = `BY_ENTREPRENEUR`

**Initial Cascade Order**: Default is creation order (1, 2, 3...). Admin can manually reorder ventures in the Admin Panel to change rotation priority.

#### Timeout Processor (MVP — Simple Auto-Assignment)

> **MVP Scope:** Uses a lightweight in-process timer (`setInterval` every 30 seconds) running inside the Hono server. When an offer times out, the engine **auto-assigns** the order to the next available venture — no additional offer/wait cycle.

**MVP Timeout Flow:**
1. `setInterval` runs every 30 seconds inside Hono process
2. Scan `Cascade_Assignment` where `offer_status = WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE` AND `response_deadline < now()`
3. Mark timed-out assignment as `offer_status = TIMEOUT`
4. Find the **next available venture** in cascade order that passes all filter checks (active, not paused, has capacity, is open)
5. **Auto-assign:** Set order `status = CONFIRMED`, set `confirmed_venture_id`, create `Cascade_Assignment` with `offer_status = ACCEPTED`
6. Notify entrepreneur of the auto-assigned order
7. If no venture is available → Mark order as `EXPIRED` with `cancel_reason = NO_VENTURE_AVAILABLE`

> **POST-MVP Evolution:** Replace `setInterval` with a proper job queue (BullMQ + Redis) for reliability and persistence across restarts. Add full cascade retry (offer → wait → timeout → next) instead of auto-assignment. See §3.1.1 for offline handling details.

### 3.1.1. Offline Handling & Timeout Management **[POST-MVP]**

> **Problem:** In conservation areas, entrepreneurs have intermittent connectivity. A venture may be offline when the timeout expires, causing confusion and lost business opportunities.

### 3.1.2. Race Condition Prevention in Cascade Accept **[POST-MVP]**

> **MVP Note:** The MVP includes **basic state validation** in accept/reject endpoints: before processing, the server verifies that the order is in `OFFER_PENDING` status and that the requesting venture matches the current offer. If conditions are not met, it returns HTTP 409 (Conflict) or 410 (Gone). Full atomic transactions with `FOR UPDATE` locks and `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level are deferred to POST-MVP.

> **Problem:** When an entrepreneur accepts an order while another is processing, or when an accept request arrives after the timeout has already expired, the system must handle this gracefully without leaving the order in an inconsistent state.

**Race Condition Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Simultaneous Accepts** | Two entrepreneurs (in rare cases of system misconfiguration) attempt to accept the same order at the exact same time |
| **Accept After Timeout** | An entrepreneur's accept request arrives after the timeout has expired and the order was already offered to the next venture |
| **Network Delay** | Entrepreneur sends accept, network is slow, timeout expires during transit, accept arrives late |

**Solution: First-Write-Wins with Atomic Transactions**

The system uses atomic database operations to ensure only the first accepted offer succeeds:

```
ACCEPT REQUEST FLOW:

1. START TRANSACTION (SERIALIZABLE isolation level)

2. SELECT order FROM Order WHERE id = :orderId 
   FOR UPDATE  ← Lock the row to prevent concurrent modifications

3. VALIDATE current status:
   - If status = 'CONFIRMED' → REJECT (already accepted by another)
   - If status = 'EXPIRED' → REJECT (cascade already finished)
   - If status = 'CANCELLED' → REJECT (tourist cancelled)
   - If status = 'OFFER_PENDING' AND venture_id matches → PROCEED
   - If status = 'OFFER_PENDING' AND venture_id does NOT match → REJECT (not your turn)

4. UPDATE Order SET status = 'CONFIRMED', confirmed_venture_id = :ventureId

5. UPDATE Cascade_Assignment SET offer_status = 'ACCEPTED', resolved_at = now()
   WHERE order_id = :orderId AND venture_id = :ventureId

6. CREATE notification for tourist: ORDER_CONFIRMED

7. COMMIT TRANSACTION
```

**Response to Late Accepts:**

| Scenario | Server Response | Message to Entrepreneur |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Order already CONFIRMED by another | HTTP 409 Conflict | "Este pedido ya fue confirmado por otro emprendimiento" |
| Order EXPIRED | HTTP 410 Gone | "El pedido expiró y fue reasignado. Lo sentimos!" |
| Order CANCELLED | HTTP 410 Gone | "El cliente canceló este pedido" |
| Not your turn (OFFER_PENDING but different venture) | HTTP 409 Conflict | "No es tu turno de responder este pedido" |
| **SUCCESS** | HTTP 200 OK | "¡Pedido confirmado! El cliente fue notificado" |

**Database Constraint (Defense in Depth):**

Add a partial unique index to prevent any possibility of double confirmation:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_order_single_confirmed 
ON Order (id) 
WHERE status = 'CONFIRMED';
```

This ensures at the database level that only ONE row can have status = 'CONFIRMED' for any order.

### 3.1.3. Idempotency for Accept/Reject Operations **[POST-MVP]**

To handle network retries and duplicate requests:

```
- Accept/Reject requests MUST include Idempotency-Key header
- Server stores (order_id, idempotency_key, result) with 24-hour TTL
- If duplicate request arrives:
  - Return cached result without re-processing
  - Do NOT execute cascade logic again
```

### 3.1.4. Cascade Snapshot (Frozen Rotation Order) **[POST-MVP]**

> **Problem:** If an admin reorders ventures while an order is in cascade, the order might skip or double-visit ventures unexpectedly.

**Solution:** When an order enters the cascade flow, snapshot the current `cascade_order`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Order ADD COLUMN cascade_snapshot JSONB;

-- When order is created:
UPDATE Order SET cascade_snapshot = (
    SELECT jsonb_object_agg(id, cascade_order)
    FROM Venture 
    WHERE catalog_type_id = :requiredTypeId
);

-- Cascade always reads from snapshot, not current table:
SELECT * FROM jsonb_each_text(cascade_snapshot) ORDER BY value::int;
```

**Timeout Processor (Background Job):**

A scheduled job runs every 30 seconds to process expired offers:

1. **Scan**: Find all `Cascade_Assignment` where `offer_status = WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE` AND `response_deadline < now()`
2. **Mark Timeout**: Update assignment to `offer_status = TIMEOUT`, set `resolved_at = now()`
3. **Continue Cascade**: Trigger next attempt (move to next venture in rotation order)
4. **Log**: Record the timeout for analytics and debugging

**Entrepreneur Reconnection Flow:**

When an entrepreneur returns online:

1. **Pull State**: App calls `GET /orders/pending` with `last_known_status` parameter
2. **Compare**: Server compares client's known state with actual state
3. **Delta Response**: Return only changes (accepted, rejected, expired, new offers)
4. **UI Update**: Show current status - if offer expired, display "Expirado" with reason

**Lost Offer Notification:**

When an offer expires due to timeout:

1. Mark assignment as `TIMEOUT`
2. Create notification record: `event_type = OFFER_EXPIRED`
3. Send push notification: "Tu respuesta expiró. El pedido fue reenviado a otro emprendimiento."
4. Continue cascade to next venture

**Offline Detection Strategy:**

| Scenario | Detection | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| App in foreground | Heartbeat every 30s | Mark as ONLINE |
| App in background | Push token active | Mark as PENDING |
| App closed | No heartbeat > 2 minutes | Mark as OFFLINE |
| Network error on accept | HTTP 0 / timeout | Show retry UI, queue locally |

**Entrepreneur Dashboard - Status Indicators:**

The dashboard MUST show clear visual states:

| State | Color | Message |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE` | Yellow | "Esperando tu respuesta..." |
| `ACCEPTED` | Green | "¡Confirmado! El cliente fue notificado" |
| `REJECTED` | Gray | "Rechazaste este pedido" |
| `TIMEOUT` | Red | "Expirado - El pedido fue reenviado" |
| `EXPIRED` (final) | Red | "Lo sentimos, no hay disponibilidad" |

### 3.2. Internationalization (i18n) **[POST-MVP]**

> **MVP:** Only Spanish (`es`) is required. i18n structure in place but not active.
*   Dynamic Catalog data (dish and activity names) are stored in the database using PostgreSQL's native `JSONB` type [6].
*   This allows the system to quickly extract translations (e.g., `{"es": "Guiso", "en": "Stew"}) based on the tourist's browser `Accept-Language` header [6].

**Fallback Strategy:**
1. Use the language from `Accept-Language` header (e.g., "es", "en", "fr")
2. If the requested language is not available, fall back to the project's `default_language`
3. If the default language is also not available, use the first available language in the translation object
4. If no translation exists at all, return the key (e.g., "ORDER_CONFIRMED") as the message

**Translation Helper:**
```typescript
function getTranslation(translations: Record<string, string>, acceptLanguage: string, defaultLang: string): string {
    const lang = acceptLanguage.split(',')[0].slice(0, 2); // 'es' from 'es,en;q=0.9'
    
    if (translations[lang]) return translations[lang];
    if (translations[defaultLang]) return translations[defaultLang];
    return Object.values(translations)[0] || lang; // First available or lang code
}
```

**Supported Languages per Project:** Each project defines its supported languages in `Project.supported_languages` (JSON array, e.g., `["es", "en", "pt"]`). The first language in the array is the default.

### 3.3. Validation Rules **[MVP]**

#### 3.3.1 Order Creation Validations

When a tourist creates an order, the following validations must pass:

| Field | Validation Rule | Error Message |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| `service_date` | Required | "Date is required" |
| `service_date` | Must be >= TODAY | "Cannot order for past dates" |
| `service_date` | Must be <= TODAY + 30 days | "Cannot order more than 30 days in advance" |
| `guest_count` | Required | "Number of guests is required" |
| `guest_count` | Must be >= 1 | "At least 1 guest is required" |
| `guest_count` | Must be <= 100 | "Maximum 100 guests per order" |
| `items` | Required, array, min 1, max 1 | "Only 1 item per order" |
| `items[].catalog_item_id` | Required | "Item is required" |
| `items[].quantity` | Required, min 1 | "Quantity must be at least 1" |
| `time_of_day_id` | Required | "Time of day is required" |

#### 3.3.2 Venture Availability Validations (Filter Phase)

> **Note:** Business fields are now in Venture entity. Cascade iterates through Ventures.

Before offering an order to a venture, the engine validates:

| Check | Condition | Skip Reason |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Venture Active | `venture.is_active = true` | `VENTURE_INACTIVE` |
| General Pause | `venture.is_paused = false` | `GENERAL_PAUSE` |
| Capacity | `(current_occupation + order.guest_count) <= venture.max_capacity` | `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED` |

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT — Capacity Unit:** Capacity is ALWAYS measured by **number of guests (personas/guest_count)**, NEVER by number of items or dishes ordered. A Venture with `max_capacity = 20` can serve 20 **people** regardless of how many dishes each person orders. All capacity checks (`CAPACITY_EXCEEDED`), occupation calculations (`getCurrentOccupation`), and calendar displays (`occupied_seats / max_capacity`) use `guest_count` as the unit.
| Individual Pause | `catalog_item_id NOT IN (SELECT catalog_item_id FROM venture_paused_item WHERE venture_id = venture.id)` | `INDIVIDUAL_PAUSE` |
| **Opening Hours** | Order time within `venture.opening_hours` for the day | `CLOSED_THAT_DAY` |

**Opening Hours Logic:**
```typescript
function isVentureOpen(venture: Venture, serviceDate: Date, timeOfDayId: number): boolean {
    const dayOfWeek = getDayOfWeek(serviceDate); // 'mon', 'tue', ...
    const hours = venture.opening_hours[dayOfWeek];
    
    if (!hours) return false; // Venture is closed that day
    
    const [openTime, closeTime] = hours.split('-');
    const orderTime = getStartTimeForTimeOfDay(timeOfDayId); // e.g., '12:00' for LUNCH
    
    return orderTime >= openTime && orderTime < closeTime;
}
```

#### 3.3.3 Order Status Transitions

Valid transitions between order states:

```
SEARCHING ──offer──> OFFER_PENDING ──accept──> CONFIRMED ──complete──> COMPLETED
    │                     │                      │              │
    ├──cancel──> CANCELLED ├──cancel──> CANCELLED ├──cancel──> SEARCHING
    │                     │                      │              │
    └──expire──> EXPIRED  └──expire──> EXPIRED   └──no_show──> NO_SHOW
```

**State Transition Rules:**
- `SEARCHING` → `OFFER_PENDING`: When engine offers order to a venture (intermediate state prevents race conditions)
- `OFFER_PENDING` → `CONFIRMED`: When linked entrepreneur accepts for their venture
- `OFFER_PENDING` → `SEARCHING`: When venture rejects or times out (cascade continues to next venture)
- `OFFER_PENDING` → `CANCELLED`: When tourist cancels while venture has pending offer
- `SEARCHING` → `CANCELLED`: When tourist cancels (only if status = SEARCHING)
- `SEARCHING` → `EXPIRED`: When max cascade attempts reached or all ventures skipped
- `CONFIRMED` → `SEARCHING`: When linked entrepreneur cancels (cascade restarts from next venture), sets cancel_reason = BY_ENTREPRENEUR
- `CONFIRMED` → `COMPLETED`: (1) When entrepreneur explicitly marks as complete via `/orders/:id/complete`, OR (2) When service date passes + no NO_SHOW reported
- `CONFIRMED` → `NO_SHOW`: When linked entrepreneur marks tourist as no-show

> **UX Note:** The explicit `/complete` action is the PREFERRED flow. Entrepreneurs should mark the order as complete when they finish preparing the dish or when the service is delivered. The automatic completion (date-based) is a fallback for cases where the entrepreneur forgets to mark it.

#### 3.3.4 Cascade Skip Reasons

Complete list of skip reasons in `Cascade_Assignment.skip_reason`:

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `null` | Venture was offered (not skipped) |
| `GENERAL_PAUSE` | Venture has is_paused = true |
| `INDIVIDUAL_PAUSE` | catalog_item_id is in Venture_Paused_Item for this venture |
| `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED` | (current_occupation + guest_count) > venture.max_capacity |
| `CLOSED_THAT_DAY` | Venture is closed on the requested day (not in opening_hours) |
| `OUTSIDE_OPENING_HOURS` | Requested time is outside venture's operating hours |
| `VENTURE_INACTIVE` | Venture.is_active = false |
| `NOT_OFFERED` | Venture was not in the rotation list |

#### 3.3.5 Order Duplication Prevention

A tourist cannot have multiple active orders for the same:
- `service_date` + `time_of_day_id`

If such order exists with status `SEARCHING` or `CONFIRMED`, the system returns error: "You already have an order for this time slot"

#### 3.3.6 Capacity Calculation — Unit: Guest Count (Occupation Tracking)

When checking if a venture can accept an order, the system calculates **accumulated occupation** from all CONFIRMED orders for that time slot:

```typescript
function getCurrentOccupation(ventureId: number, serviceDate: Date, timeOfDayId: number): number {
    // Sum of guest_count for CONFIRMED orders at same date/time
    // Only CONFIRMED orders count toward capacity - SEARCHING/OFFER_PENDING orders are not yet assigned
    return SUM(o.guest_count) FROM Order o
    WHERE o.confirmed_venture_id = ventureId
      AND o.service_date = serviceDate
      AND o.time_of_day_id = time_of_day_id
      AND o.status = 'CONFIRMED';
}

async function canAcceptOrder(venture: Venture, order: Order): Promise<boolean> {
    const currentOccupation = await getCurrentOccupation(
        venture.id, 
        order.service_date, 
        order.time_of_day_id
    );
    // Check if adding new guests would exceed capacity
    return (currentOccupation + order.guest_count) <= venture.max_capacity;
}
```

**Cascade Filter Phase**: When the engine evaluates a venture, it calculates current occupation:
```typescript
if (currentOccupation + order.guest_count > venture.max_capacity) {
    return { skip: true, reason: 'CAPACITY_EXCEEDED', currentOccupation, maxCapacity: venture.max_capacity };
}
```

**Calendar Response** now includes occupation details:
```json
{
  "time_slots": [{
    "time_of_day_id": 1,
    "current_occupation": 12,
    "max_capacity": 20,
    "available_seats": 8
  }]
}
```

## 4. Technical Architecture & Tech Stack

To meet the requirement of running smoothly on low-end devices while serving Web and Android users efficiently:

*   **Frontend Framework:** **React Native using Expo**. This allows writing a single codebase that compiles into a lightweight Android application (APK/AAB) and a responsive Web application.
*   **Performance Constraint:** Avoid heavy UI animations and large client-side bundle sizes to ensure performance on low-end hardware.
*   **Runtime:** **Bun**. High-performance JavaScript/TypeScript runtime used as both the package manager (`bun install`) and the execution environment (`bun run`). Chosen for native TypeScript support without transpilation, built-in test runner, and superior performance over Node.js for this workload.
*   **Backend Framework:** **Hono** (on Bun). Ultralight (~14KB, zero deps) web framework built on Web Standards (Request/Response). Runs natively on `Bun.serve()` without compatibility layers, providing Express-like DX (routing, middleware, path params) at near-raw performance. Enables sharing TypeScript interfaces and type definitions between frontend and backend for end-to-end type safety.
*   **ORM:** **Drizzle ORM**. Type-safe SQL-first ORM with zero runtime overhead. Schema defined in TypeScript with `pgEnum`, `pgTable`, and type inference via `$inferSelect`/`$inferInsert`.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (ERD defined below).
*   **State Management:** **Zustand**. Minimal, performant state management for React Native.
*   **Styling:** **NativeWind v5** + Tailwind CSS v4 + `react-native-css`. CSS-first configuration with `@theme` tokens in CSS (not JS config). Components wrapped with `useCssElement` for `className` support.
*   **Monorepo:** **Bun Workspaces**. Single repository with multiple projects sharing types and validators.

**Dependency flow:**

```
apps/backend ──imports──► packages/shared (types, validators)
apps/mobile  ──imports──► packages/shared (types, validators)
apps/mobile  ──imports──► packages/ui     (CSS-wrapped components, tokens)
```

> **Key rule:** Types and validation schemas are defined ONCE in `@repo/shared` and consumed by both apps. This guarantees end-to-end type safety: if a field changes in the backend schema, TypeScript will flag mismatches in the mobile app at compile time.

### 4.1 Security Requirements

*   **Authentication - Tourist (No Login):**
    *   No traditional login — token generated on first visit
    *   Browser fingerprint binds session to browser instance
    *   Access token: 1 hour expiry
    *   Refresh token: 30 days, opaque

*   **Authentication - Entrepreneur/Admin (Password Login):**
    *   JWT-based authentication with email/password
    *   Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies (web) or secure storage (mobile)
    *   Password hashed with bcrypt or argon2 (cost factor 10+)

*   **Tourist Device Binding & Security **[MVP]****

> **Note:** Tourists access via **Web** (React Native Expo web), NOT a native app. This section applies ONLY to tourists.

> **MVP Implementation:**

| Layer | Protection | Implementation |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Browser Fingerprint** | Tie tokens to browser instance | JWT contains `device_fingerprint` (User-Agent + Screen + Timezone) |
| **Refresh Token** | 30-day opaque token | Stored in localStorage, sent on refresh requests |

**Token Structure (MVP - Web):**

```typescript
// Access Token (JWT) - 1 hour
{
  "sub": "user_id",
  "device_fingerprint": "sha256(browser_fingerprint)",
  "type": "access",
  "exp": 1234567890,
  "iat": 1234564290
}

// Refresh Token - Opaque, 30 days
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "device_fingerprint": "sha256(...)",
  "expires_at": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z",
  "is_revoked": false
}
```

**Browser Fingerprint Generation (MVP):**

```typescript
function generateBrowserFingerprint(): string {
  const components = [
    navigator.userAgent,
    navigator.language,
    screen.width + 'x' + screen.height,
    Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone,
  ];
  return sha256(components.join('|'));
}
```

### 4.1.2. Refresh Token Rotation for Password Login **[POST-MVP]**

> **Problem:** If a refresh token is stolen (Entrepreneur/Admin login), attacker can use it indefinitely until expiration.

> **Applies to:** Entrepreneur and Admin authentication (password-based login).

**Solution: Single-Use Refresh Tokens**

Each refresh request generates a new token, invalidating the old one:

```
1. Client sends: { refresh_token: "uuid" }
2. Server validates and generates NEW token
3. Old token is marked as "rotated" (one-time use only)
4. Returns: { new_access_token, new_refresh_token }
```

**Token Structure (POST-MVP):**

```typescript
// Refresh Token - Single-use
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "device_fingerprint": "sha256(...)",
  "hashed_token": "bcrypt_hash",
  "expires_at": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z",
  "rotated_at": null,
  "is_revoked": false
}
```

**Refresh Token Rotation Flow:**

```
1. Client sends: { refresh_token: "uuid" }
2. Server validates and generates NEW token
3. Old token is marked as "rotated" (one-time use only)
4. Returns: { new_access_token, new_refresh_token }
```

**Revocation Endpoint (POST-MVP):**

```
POST /auth/tourist/revoke-all
Request:
{
  "user_id": "uuid (required)"
}

Response (200):
{
  "message": "All sessions revoked successfully",
  "revoked_count": 3
}
```

**Password Security:**
    *   Global: 100 requests/minute per IP
    *   Order creation: 10 orders/minute per device token
    *   Auth endpoints: 5 attempts/minute per IP
*   **Account Lockout:** After 5 failed login attempts, lock account for 15 minutes.
*   **Input Validation:** All inputs sanitized. SQL injection prevented via parameterized queries (Knex/Prisma). XSS prevented via output encoding.
*   **API Security:** All endpoints require authentication except: `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/tourist/create`, `POST /auth/tourist/refresh`, `POST /auth/tourist/revoke`, `POST /orders` (tourist), `GET /catalog`, `GET /ventures`.

### 4.2 API Design

All endpoints follow RESTful conventions. Base URL: `https://api.elimpenetrable.org/v1`

> **MVP:** Only Tourist + Entrepreneur endpoints (4.2.1 - 4.2.3). Admin endpoints (4.2.4) are **[POST-MVP]**.

#### 4.2.1 Public Endpoints (No Authentication Required) **[MVP]**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/auth/tourist/create` | Create tourist identity with alias |
| POST | `/auth/tourist/refresh` | Refresh tourist JWT token |
| POST | `/auth/tourist/revoke` | Revoke tourist JWT token (logout/lost device) |
| GET | `/catalog` | Get all catalog items for a project |
| GET | `/ventures` | List ventures (businesses) for a project |

**POST /auth/tourist/create**
```json
Request:
{
  "alias": "string (required, 1-50 chars)",

}

Response (201):
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "access_token": "jwt (1 hour)",
  "refresh_token": "uuid (opaque, 30 days)",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

**POST /auth/tourist/refresh**
```json
Request:
{
  "refresh_token": "uuid (opaque token)",
  "device_fingerprint": "string (browser fingerprint)"
}

Response (200):
{
  "access_token": "jwt (new, 1 hour)",

### 4.3 Real-Time Notifications

> **MVP:** Push Notifications only (4.3.1). WhatsApp (4.3.3) and Polling fallback (4.3.2) are **[POST-MVP]**.

#### 4.3.1 Push Notifications (Primary) **[MVP]**

**Provider:** Expo Push Notifications (no Firebase configuration required)

**Flow:**
1. App registers with Expo Push → obtains `ExponentPushToken[xxx]`
2. Push token stored in `Notification_Preference` / `Tourist_Device.push_token`
3. When event occurs → backend sends to Expo Push API (`https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send`) → Expo delivers to device

**Device Registration Endpoint:**
```
POST /notifications/register
Request: { "push_token": "ExponentPushToken[xxx]" }
Response: { "success": true }
```

**Events that trigger Push Notifications:**

| Event | Recipient | Channel | Content |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|
| `ORDER_RECEIVED` | Entrepreneur | Push | "Nuevo pedido: X personas, [items]" |
| `ORDER_CANCELLED` | Entrepreneur | Push | "El cliente canceló el pedido #X" |
| `ORDER_CONFIRMED` | Tourist | Push + WhatsApp | "Tu reserva está confirmada para [fecha] en [venture]" |
| `ORDER_COMPLETED` | Tourist | Push | "Tu experiencia en [venture] fue completada. ¡Gracias por visitar!" |
| `ORDER_NO_SHOW` | Tourist | Push | "El emprendimiento reportó que no te presentaste. ¿Qué pasó?" |
| `ORDER_EXPIRED` | Tourist | Push | "Lo sentimos, no hay disponibilidad para tu solicitud" |
| `MORNING_REMINDER` | Entrepreneur | Push + WhatsApp | "Hoy tienes X pedidos confirmados" |

#### 4.3.2 Polling (Fallback) **[POST-MVP]**

For devices without push token or when push fails, the app polls periodically.

**Polling Endpoint:**
```
GET /orders/pending?last_check=timestamp
Response: { "has_new": true/false, "orders": [...] }
```

**Polling Strategy:**

| Scenario | Interval | Trigger |
|----------|----------|---------|
| App in foreground | 30 seconds | Automatic |
| App in background | 5 minutes | Background fetch |
| On app resume | Immediate | Event listener |

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Frontend polling
const startPolling = () => {
  setInterval(async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/orders/pending');
    const { orders } = await response.json();
    if (orders.length > 0) showLocalNotification(orders);
  }, 30000);
};
```

#### 4.3.3 WhatsApp Notifications **[POST-MVP]**

For high-priority notifications to tourists (confirmation, expiration).

**Provider:** WhatsApp Business API (Meta)

**Flow:**
1. Tourist provides WhatsApp number in profile
2. Backend sends via WhatsApp Business API
3. Message ID stored in `Notification.external_id`

**Endpoint:**
```
POST /notifications/whatsapp

COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
ENV NODE_ENV=production
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["bun", "run", "dist/main.js"]
```

### 4.5.2 Database Migrations

**Tool:** Drizzle Kit (`drizzle-kit`)

**Migration Files Structure:**
```
drizzle/
  0001_create_enums.sql
  0002_create_project.sql
  0003_create_users.sql
  ...
```

**Commands:**
```bash
# Generate migrations from schema changes
bun run drizzle-kit generate

# Apply migrations to database
bun run drizzle-kit migrate

# Open Drizzle Studio (visual DB browser)
bun run drizzle-kit studio
```

**Seeding (MVP — CLI Seed Script):**

> **MVP Scope:** Since the Admin Panel is [POST-MVP], all initial data is loaded via CLI seed scripts. This covers: Projects, Catalog Types, Catalog Items, Ventures, Entrepreneurs, and Venture Schedules.

```bash
# Seed database with Impenetrable project data
bun run db:seed

# Seed with custom data file
bun run db:seed --file seeds/impenetrable.ts
```

**Seed Data Structure (TypeScript):**
```typescript
// seeds/impenetrable.ts
export const seedData = {
  project: {
    name: 'Impenetrable',
    default_language: 'es',
    supported_languages: ['es'],
    cascade_timeout_minutes: 30,
    max_cascade_attempts: 10,
  },
  catalogTypes: [
    { name: 'Gastronomy', description: 'Local food experiences' },
    { name: 'Guide Services', description: 'Guided tours and activities' },
  ],
  catalogItems: [
    { type: 'Gastronomy', name_i18n: { es: 'Guiso' }, price: 15.00 },
    { type: 'Gastronomy', name_i18n: { es: 'Empanadas' }, price: 12.00 },

- **Errors:** Sentry or Datadog
- **Uptime:** UptimeRobot or Grafana synthetic checks

**Key Metrics to Track:**
| Metric | Description | Alert Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `orders_per_minute` | Order creation rate | > 100/min |
| `cascade_avg_attempts` | Average cascade attempts | > 8 |
| `response_time_p95` | API response time (95th percentile) | > 500ms |
| `error_rate` | Percentage of 5xx errors | > 1% |

- **Retention:** 30 days
- **Storage:** AWS S3 or equivalent

**Backup Command:**
```bash
pg_dump -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER $DB_NAME | gzip > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz
```

**Recovery Procedure:**
1. Stop application
2. Drop existing database
3. Restore from latest backup: `gunzip < backup.sql.gz | psql`
4. Verify data integrity
5. Restart application

### 4.5.7 Security

| Practice | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Secrets | Use environment variables or secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, Doppler) |

## 4.6 Testing Strategy **[MVP]**

> **MVP:** Only Unit Tests for Cascade Engine required. Integration/E2E are **[POST-MVP]**.

### 4.6.1 Testing Pyramid

```
        /\
       /  \
      / E2E \         ← Few, slow, expensive
     /--------\
    /Integration\    ← Medium, test component interaction
   /--------------\
  /    Unit        \ ← Many, fast, cheap
 /__________________\
```

### 4.6.2 Unit Tests

**Framework:** Bun Test (Vitest-compatible)

**Coverage Target:** 80% minimum

**What to Test:**

| Module | Test Cases |
|--------|------------|
| **CascadeEngine** | Skip logic for all 8 skip reasons, capacity calculation, max attempts |
| **i18n** | Fallback strategy, missing language handling |
| **Auth** | Token refresh, lockout logic, JWT validation |
| **Validation** | All validation rules from Section 3.3 |
| **Order** | Status transitions, duplication prevention |

**Example:**
```typescript
describe('CascadeEngine', () => {
  describe('filterVenture', () => {
    it('skips when venture.is_active = false', () => {
      const venture = { is_active: false, ... };
      const result = filterVenture(venture, order);
      expect(result.skip).toBe(true);
      expect(result.reason).toBe('VENTURE_INACTIVE');
    });

    it('skips when general_pause = true', () => {
      const venture = { general_pause: true, ... };
      const result = filterVenture(venture, order);
      expect(result.skip).toBe(true);
      expect(result.reason).toBe('GENERAL_PAUSE');
    });

    it('skips when guest_count > max_capacity', () => {
      const venture = { max_capacity: 10, ... };
      const order = { guest_count: 15 };
      const result = filterVenture(venture, order);
      expect(result.skip).toBe(true);
      expect(result.reason).toBe('CAPACITY_EXCEEDED');
    });

    it('skips when outside opening_hours', () => {
      const venture = { opening_hours: { mon: '08:00-20:00' } };
      const order = { service_date: '2024-01-15', time_of_day_id: LUNCH }; // 12:00
      const result = filterVenture(venture, order);
      expect(result.skip).toBe(false);
    });
  });

  describe('cascadeLoop', () => {
    it('marks EXPIRED after max_attempts', async () => {
      const ventures = [...Array(10).keys()].map(i => ({ id: i, ... }));
      const result = await cascadeLoop(order, ventures, { max_attempts: 10 });
      expect(result.status).toBe('EXPIRED');
    });

    it('returns CONFIRMED on first accept', async () => {
      const ventures = [{ id: 1, ... }];
      const result = await cascadeLoop(order, ventures, {});
      expect(result.status).toBe('CONFIRMED');
    });
  });
});
```

### 4.6.3 Integration Tests

**Framework:** Supertest (API) + Test Database

**What to Test:**

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Order Flow** | Tourist creates order → enters SEARCHING → venture accepts → becomes CONFIRMED |
| **Cascade Flow** | Order creates → skips paused ventures → reaches active venture → accepts |
| **Auth Flow** | Tourist creates identity → gets JWT → refreshes token → token invalidates old |
| **Notification Flow** | Order confirmed → notification created → sent via provider |

**Example:**
```typescript
describe('Order API', () => {
  it('creates order and triggers cascade', async () => {
    // Create order
    const orderRes = await request(app)
      .post('/orders')
      .send({ ... });
    
    expect(orderRes.status).toBe(201);
    expect(orderRes.body.status).toBe('SEARCHING');

    // Check cascade assignment created
    const assignment = await db.query(
      'SELECT * FROM cascade_assignment WHERE order_id = ?',
      [orderRes.body.order_id]
    );
    expect(assignment).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(assignment[0].offer_status).toBe('WAITING_FOR_RESPONSE');
  });

  it('accepts order and confirms', async () => {
    // Given: order in SEARCHING
    const order = await createOrder({ status: 'SEARCHING' });

    // When: entrepreneur accepts
    const acceptRes = await request(app)
      .post(`/orders/${order.id}/accept`)
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${entrepreneurToken}`);

    // Then: order is CONFIRMED
    expect(acceptRes.body.status).toBe('CONFIRMED');
    
    const updatedOrder = await getOrder(order.id);
    expect(updatedOrder.status).toBe('CONFIRMED');
  });
});
```

### 4.6.4 E2E Tests

**Framework:** Playwright (recommended)

**Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Steps |
|----------|-------|
| **Tourist: Create Order** | 1. Open app → 2. Enter alias → 3. Browse catalog → 4. Select item → 5. Choose date/time → 6. Submit → 7. See "SEARCHING" status |
| **Entrepreneur: Accept Order** | 1. Login → 2. See pending order → 3. Tap Accept → 4. See confirmation |
| **Full Cascade** | 1. Tourist creates order → 2. Venture A rejects → 3. Venture B accepts → 4. Tourist sees CONFIRMED |

**Example:**
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('tourist creates order', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  
  // Welcome screen
  await page.fill('[name=alias]', 'Test Family');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Start")');
  
  // Catalog
  await expect(page.locator('text=Service Catalog')).toBeVisible();
  await page.click('text=Guiso');
  
  // Order modal
  await page.selectOption('[name=time_of_day]', 'LUNCH');
  await page.fill('[name=guest_count]', '4');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Confirm")');
  
  // Orders screen
  await expect(page.locator('text=SEARCHING')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### 4.6.5 Load Testing

**Tool:** k6 or Artillery

**Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Target |
|----------|--------|
| **Order Creation** | 100 orders/minute |
| **Cascade Engine** | 50 ventures, 10 attempts each |
| **Concurrent Accepts** | 10 ventures accepting simultaneously |
| **Calendar View** | 1000 confirmed orders |

**Example (k6):**
```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';

export const options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: '1m',
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'],
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],
  },
};

export default function () {
  const order = {
    service_date: '2024-01-15',
    time_of_day_id: 1,
    guest_count: 4,
    items: [
      { "catalog_item_id": 1, "quantity": 2 }
    ],
  };

  http.post('http://localhost:3000/v1/orders', 
    JSON.stringify(order),
    { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }
  );
}
```

### 4.6.6 Test Database Strategy

**Development:**
- Use `testcontainers` for isolated PostgreSQL
- Each test gets clean database state

**CI/CD:**
- Use ephemeral database per build
- Run migrations before tests
- Seed with minimal data

```typescript
// Test setup
beforeAll(async () => {
  const container = await new PostgreSqlContainer().start();
  await runMigrations(container.getConnectionUrl());
});

afterAll(async () => {
  await container.stop();
});

beforeEach(async () => {
  await truncateAllTables();
  await seedTestData();
});
```

### 4.6.7 Test Coverage Requirements

| Type | Minimum Coverage | Tools |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Unit | 80% | Bun Test + coverage report |
| Integration | All API endpoints | Supertest |
| E2E | Critical paths only | Playwright |
| Load | Key endpoints | k6 |

### 4.6.8 Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (fast, runs on every commit)
bun test

# With coverage
bun test --coverage
```

## 5. Data Structure (Multi-Project ERD) **[MVP - Partial]**

> **MVP:** Only single Project (Impenetrable). Multi-project support is **[POST-MVP]**.

Below is the relational data model prepared for AI generation using PostgreSQL. Operational states are kept as Enums to protect the cascading engine's strict logic, while expansible categories use parametric tables [6].

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

### 7.1 Team Context

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Team Size | 1 developer (solo) |
| Availability | Part-time (~20 hours/week) |
| Primary Experience | Backend: C++, Java, Go (20 years) |
| Secondary Experience | React, React Native, TypeScript APIs (some experience) |

> **Strategy (Frontend-First with Mocks):** Although the developer's strength is backend, to reduce product risk, the project will follow a "Frontend-First" approach. The `shared` package will define the data contracts (TypeScript interfaces, Zod validators). Then, the React Native mobile app will be built using **Zustand** to mock API responses. This allows rapid iteration and UX validation with the client using a real APK/Web app before investing time in the complex database and routing engine.

### 7.2 MVP Implementation Timeline (Frontend-First)

| Phase | Focus | Duration (Part-time) |
|-------|-------|----------------------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation (UI & Types)** | Monorepo Setup, Shared Types (Contracts), Expo Foundation, UI Components Package | 3-4 weeks |
| **Phase 2: Mobile Mocks (UX Validation)** | Tourist Flow (Zustand mocks), Entrepreneur Flow (Zustand mocks), Client UX Iteration | 4-5 weeks |
| **Phase 3: Core Backend (The Engine)** | DB Schema, Drizzle, Hono API (Auth, Catalog, Orders), Cascade Engine algorithm | 5-6 weeks |
| **Phase 4: Integration & Polish** | Connect Mobile `fetch` to Hono API, Expo Push Notifications, DevOps, Staging | 3-5 weeks |
| **Total** | | **~15-20 weeks (3.5-5 months)** |

> **Note:** This timeline reduces the risk of building the wrong backend. Once Phase 2 is approved by the client, Phase 3 (the developer's strong suit) can be built rapidly against validated and locked-in data contracts.

### 7.3 POST-MVP Roadmap

| **P1** | WhatsApp Notifications | WhatsApp Business API integration |
| **P1** | Token Rotation | Single-use refresh tokens, revoke-all endpoint |
| **P2** | Idempotency | Idempotency-Key header, cached responses, 24h TTL (requires Redis) |
| **P2** | Cascade Snapshot | Frozen rotation order per order |
| **P2** | Polling Fallback | 30s foreground, 5min background |
| **P2** | Morning Reminder | Cron job: daily agenda via push + WhatsApp |
| **P2** | E2E & Load Testing | Playwright E2E, k6 load testing |
| **P3** | i18n Active | Multi-language support beyond Spanish |
| **P3** | Multi-Project | Support for multiple conservation projects |

### 7.4 Redis Dependency (POST-MVP Only)

> **MVP does NOT require Redis.** Rate limiting uses in-memory storage, timeout processing uses `setInterval`, and sessions use JWT + PostgreSQL.

Redis is introduced in POST-MVP for:
- **Job Queues (BullMQ):** Reliable timeout processing with full cascade retry, morning reminders
- **Idempotency Cache:** 24h TTL for request deduplication
- **Distributed Rate Limiting:** Required when running multiple server instances
- **Pub/Sub:** Real-time event distribution across instances

### 7.5 Implementation Task Checklist (MVP)

> **Note:** Use this checklist as your day-to-day reference. Every task is small, actionable, and designed to support the **Frontend-First** strategy.

#### Phase 1: Foundation (UI & Contracts)
- [ ] **1.1 Monorepo**: Initialize Bun workspace root (`package.json`, `bunfig.toml`, `tsconfig.base.json`).
- [ ] **1.2 Shared**: Create `@repo/shared` package with `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`.
- [ ] **1.3 Shared**: Define Zod validators/Types for `Tourist`, `Entrepreneur`, `Venture`, `CatalogItem`.
- [ ] **1.4 Shared**: Define Zod validators/Types for `Order`, `Order_Item`, `Cascade_Assignment`.
- [ ] **1.5 Shared**: Export Enums (`Order_Status`, `Cancel_Reason`) from `constants.ts`.
- [ ] **1.6 Mobile**: Initialize Expo React Native app in `apps/mobile` (`npx create-expo-app`).
- [ ] **1.7 Mobile**: Configure `NativeWind v5` and `Tailwind CSS`.
- [ ] **1.8 UI**: Create `@repo/ui` package with base components (Button, Card, Input) styled with NativeWind.
- [ ] **1.9 Workspace**: Link `@repo/ui` and `@repo/shared` as dependencies in `apps/mobile`.

#### Phase 2: Mobile Mocks (UX Validation)
- [ ] **2.1 Store**: Setup Zustand `useTouristStore` with mock ventures and active orders data.
- [ ] **2.2 Store**: Setup Zustand `useEntrepreneurStore` with mock incoming orders and calendar data.
- [ ] **2.3 UI/Tourist**: Build Welcome & Authentication screen (Mock magic link).
- [ ] **2.4 UI/Tourist**: Build Catalog list and Venture Detail views.
- [ ] **2.5 UI/Tourist**: Build Order Creation modal and Order Tracking screen.
- [ ] **2.6 UI/Entrepreneur**: Build Dashboard (Incoming order cards, Accept/Reject buttons).
- [ ] **2.7 UI/Entrepreneur**: Build Calendar (Slots, Occupancy bars based on `guest_count`).
- [ ] **2.8 UI/Entrepreneur**: Build Configuration view (Toggle pause statuses).
- [ ] **2.9 Interactive Flow**: Wire Zustand stores so Tourist creating an order triggers an incoming order on Entrepreneur dashboard.

> **Stop here:** Validate the interactive Mobile APK/Web prototype with the client before proceeding to Phase 3.

#### Phase 3: Core Backend (The Engine)
- [ ] **3.1 Backend**: Initialize Hono app in `apps/backend`.
- [ ] **3.2 Infra**: Setup PostgreSQL via `docker-compose.yml` (NO Redis yet).
- [ ] **3.3 DB**: Setup Drizzle ORM in `apps/backend/src/db` connecting to Postgres.
- [ ] **3.4 DB**: Translate `@repo/shared` Zod schemas into Drizzle tables and relations.
- [ ] **3.5 DB**: Create `bun run db:seed` script with initial Patagonia test data.
- [ ] **3.6 API**: Implement JWT Auth middleware and in-memory rate limiting Map.
- [ ] **3.7 API/Catalog**: Build public GET endpoints (`/ventures`, `/ventures/:id`).
- [ ] **3.8 API/Orders**: Build Tourist endpoints (POST `/orders`, GET `/orders/me`).
- [ ] **3.9 Engine**: Implement `filterVenture` logic (Validating capacity strictly via `guest_count`, pause status).
- [ ] **3.10 Engine**: Implement cascade assignment creation (`OFFER_PENDING` status).
- [ ] **3.11 API/Orders**: Build Entrepreneur endpoints (POST `/orders/:id/accept` and `reject` validating `OFFER_PENDING`).
- [ ] **3.12 Engine**: Implement Timeout Processor MVP (`setInterval` every 30s to auto-assign expired offers).

#### Phase 4: Integration & Polish
- [ ] **4.1 Mobile**: Setup Expo Push Notification tokens and update backend schema `Notification_Preference`.
- [ ] **4.2 Backend**: Implement push notification service to call Expo Push API.
- [ ] **4.3 Mobile**: Replace Zustand mock actions with real `fetch` calls to the Hono API.
- [ ] **4.4 Mobile**: Implement global error boundary and HTTP error toast notifications.
- [ ] **4.5 Testing**: E2E manual flow test: db:seed -> start backend -> place order on mobile -> cascade engine auto-assigns.
